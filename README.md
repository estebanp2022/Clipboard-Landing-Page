## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Utility first CSS Framework

### Continued development

This is my very first project using Tailwind. I'm still developing my skillset and I recently started learning this CSS framework. I'm enjoying it so far but still have ways to go before I feel confident using it. I find the customization directly on the markup easy, its the additional modules and config files (functions/directives) that I need additional exposure to/practice.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind website](https://www.tailwindcss.com) - This helped me for the overall documentation as well as learning how to tackle this project using Tailwind CLI vs the Play CDN.
- [Tailwind cheatsheet](https://nerdcave.com/tailwind-cheat-sheet) - This is an amazing one stop shop I referred back to often. Already have it bookmarked.

I'm currently taking a Udemy course on Tailwind CSS. I completed this project with the guidance of the course author Brad Traversy. Highly recommend.
